# Coverage scope and enforcement tiers

This document defines how [test-coverage.md](test-coverage.md) policy maps to **measured paths** and **CI gates**. Line coverage is collected with `cargo-tarpaulin` (LLVM profile) and summarized from Cobertura `line-rate`. Branch totals in those reports are often zero (`branches-valid="0"`); optional branch floors are enforced only when the report includes branch data.

## Tiers

| Tier | Intent | Policy target | Current CI gate (see workflows) |
|------|--------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Core library slice | `lib-q-core` sources under `lib-q-core/src`, excluding `wasm/` in PR coverage | ≥80% line on cryptographic API, validation, providers | PR `test-coverage`: **78%** line when `lib-q-core` is affected |
| Other affected crates | Full package under test when a crate path appears in the PR diff | ≥80% line (policy); gates ratchet toward that | PR `test-coverage`: **65%** line for other affected packages |
| Security-critical subset | Signing/verification entry points in `lib-q-sig` facade | ≥95% line, 100% branch when tooling emits branches | [security-critical-coverage.yml](../.github/workflows/security-critical-coverage.yml): **60%** line (ratchet toward 95%), **100%** branch when reported |

## Security-critical paths (line targets)

These are the first scoped paths used for the dedicated workflow; extend the list in that workflow when new stable entry points warrant it.

- `lib-q-sig/src/ml_dsa.rs` — ML-DSA sign/verify and key-handling surfaced through `lib-q-sig`
- `lib-q-sig/src/provider.rs` — algorithm routing and `SignatureOperations` bridge

KEM and AEAD equivalents can be added similarly (for example `lib-q-kem` / `lib-q-hpke` facade modules) once each has a stable, test-covered surface matching this pattern.

## Ratcheting

When `scripts/run-coverage.sh` or the PR coverage job passes at least **two** consecutive runs above the next milestone, raise the floor in [.github/workflows/pr.yml](../.github/workflows/pr.yml) and align [.github/workflows/coverage.yml](../.github/workflows/coverage.yml) `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` so scheduled runs stay comparable.

## Scripts

- [scripts/extract-coverage-percent.sh](../scripts/extract-coverage-percent.sh) — `line` (default) or `branch` metric from `cobertura.xml`
- [scripts/check-coverage-metrics.sh](../scripts/check-coverage-metrics.sh) — `--line-min` and optional `--branch-min` (branch skipped if no data)
- [scripts/run-coverage.sh](../scripts/run-coverage.sh) / [scripts/run-coverage.ps1](../scripts/run-coverage.ps1) — local parity with CI flags where possible

# lib-Q CI/CD Pipeline

This document describes the CI/CD pipeline implementation for lib-Q, a post-quantum cryptography library.

## Overview

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Security audit and dependency scanning
- Code quality checks (formatting, linting)
- Multi-platform testing with feature combinations
- WASM compilation and testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation generation
- Cross-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM)

#### CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)
- Automated publishing to crates.io
- WASM package publishing to npmjs.com
- GitHub release creation with changelogs
- Post-release security verification

#### Security Pipeline (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- NIST compliance validation
- Constant-time operation verification
- Memory safety and zeroization checks
- Post-quantum algorithm validation
- WASM security validation

#### PR Validation (`.github/workflows/pr.yml`)
- Code quality and security checks
- Test coverage analysis (95% threshold)
- Performance regression detection
- Documentation validation

### Development Tools

#### Security Check Scripts
- `scripts/security-check.sh` (Linux/macOS)
- `scripts/security-check.ps1` (Windows)
- Cryptographic compliance validation
- Classical algorithm detection
- Memory safety verification

#### Pre-commit Hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- Automated formatting with `cargo fmt`
- Linting with `cargo clippy`
- Security validation before commits

#### Issue & PR Templates
- Bug report template with security impact assessment
- Security vulnerability reporting template
- PR template with security checklists

#### Dependency Management (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Automated dependency updates
- Security-focused update policies
- Weekly update schedule
- Critical dependency protection

## Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Compliance
- Zero classical crypto detection
- NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms only
- SHA-3 family hash functions only
- Constant-time operation validation

### Memory Safety
- Automated memory zeroization checks
- Unsafe code usage tracking
- Comprehensive input validation

### Dependency Security
- Automated vulnerability scanning with `cargo audit`
- Controlled dependency updates
- Trusted source verification

## Publishing Process

### Automated Publishing
1. Version tag creation (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. Pre-release validation
3. Multi-platform publishing
4. Post-release verification

### Publishing Targets
- Rust crate: `crates.io` (lib-q)
- NPM package: `@lib-q/core`
- GitHub release with changelog

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup
git clone https://github.com/lib-q/lib-q.git
cd lib-q
cargo install cargo-audit cargo-tarpaulin wasm-pack
pre-commit install

# Development
git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm
# Make changes
./scripts/security-check.sh
cargo test --all-features
git commit -s -m "feat: add new algorithm"
```

### CI/CD Flow
1. Push to branch triggers CI pipeline
2. PR creation triggers validation
3. Security review (automated + manual)
4. Merge with quality gates
5. Release tag triggers CD pipeline

## Security Validation

### Automated Checks
- Classical algorithm detection
- SHA-3 compliance verification
- Constant-time operation validation
- Memory zeroization checks
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Manual Review Process
- Security team review for cryptographic changes
- Maintainer approval required
- Responsible disclosure handling

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Automated formatting with `cargo fmt`
- Zero clippy warnings
- 95% test coverage minimum
- Complete API documentation

### Performance
- Automated benchmark regression detection
- WASM performance validation
- Memory usage tracking

## Configuration

### Required Secrets
```yaml
CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN: "crates.io publish token"
NPM_TOKEN: "npm publish token"
```

### Environment Requirements
- Rust 1.70+
- Node.js 18+ (for WASM development)
- Development tools: cargo-audit, cargo-tarpaulin, wasm-pack

## Benefits

### For Developers
- Automated quality gates
- Early security issue detection
- Standardized development process
- Immediate feedback on changes

### For Users
- Reliable, quality-assured releases
- Comprehensive security validation
- Multi-platform compatibility
- WASM support for web and Node.js

### For Maintainers
- Automated publishing process
- Continuous security monitoring
- Automated dependency management
- Consistent code quality

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Configure GitHub secrets for publishing
2. Set up local development environment
3. Test pipeline with initial commit
4. Review and approve security workflows

### Future Enhancements
- Automated fuzzing integration
- Performance baseline establishment
- Regular third-party security audits
- NIST certification support

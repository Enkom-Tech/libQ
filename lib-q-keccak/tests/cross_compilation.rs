//! Cross-compilation validation tests
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive tests to ensure that cross-compilation
//! works correctly and that the resulting binaries are properly linked and
//! functionally equivalent to native builds.
//!
//! ## Security Considerations
//!
//! - All tests validate that cross-compiled binaries produce identical results
//!   to native builds for the same inputs
//! - Tests verify that architecture-specific optimizations are properly disabled
//!   during cross-compilation
//! - Binary integrity is validated through hash comparison
